# Python-OpenCV-markers-recognise
Make an image processing application on Raspberry Pi (it can be with the use of a webcam and OpenCV library) that would detect circular markers (for example, printed on a piece of paper) in the image and give their position (in pixels) in the image. In addition, the fact that any marker appeared on the image should be signaled by hardware eg using the LED diode.
